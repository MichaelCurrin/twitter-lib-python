# About

This project gives you a library of functions to choose from. It lets you get data out of Twitter in a high-level way - much more convenient than learning all the intricacies of Tweepy and the Twitter API. Especially auth and paging.

Tweepy is deliberately flexible to not go out of sync with the Twitter API, but the downside is that Tweepy doesn't validate the values before they are sent to the Twitter API. So this Python Twitter Lib project handles all that API research for you so you can focus on writing a few lines of code and letting the Lib do the heavy lifting and make decisions for you.

For more info on basic and advanced functionality of Tweepy as well as Twitter policies and docs links, see my [Python Twitter Guide](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/python-twitter-guide/) site.

**Note: This project is still in development and not properly tested.** But, the code here is of good quality and based on experience with Tweepy, so you are welcome to use something you like.
